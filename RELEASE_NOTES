New features:
-------------

- Added custom script for generation of all different graph types (cfg, ast, etc) as .dot and .pn files for every function in a project 

- Moved to a newer Tinkerpop Version (for better performance)


Bug fixes:
----------

- Fixed ResultProcessor

- Removed clone of ocopus tools in mutils

- Fixed memory leak in OctopusClientWriter

- Fixed bugs in documentaion



=============================

Version 0.2.5 introduces some new features and fixes a number of bugs.

New features:
-------------

- Users now have access to a post-dominator tree. The post-dominator
  tree was stacked onto the code property graph by introduction
  post-dominator edges that connect statements and conditions to one
  another. 

- The program dependence graph now also contains control dependence
  edges as it should be.

- 'True/False' labels have been added to control flow edges since
  users cannot be expected to know of our implicit labeling scheme.

Bug fixes:
----------

Three small changes have been made to the abstract syntax tree.

- Unary operators and sizeof-operators are now visible as separate
  nodes in the AST
- Exit-edges for while- and for- loops are now attached to the
  condition node rather than the increment-node.
- Conditions inside conditional expressions, e.g., 'x = foo? a: b;'
  now also have separate condition nodes.

Finally, in some cases, DEF/USE edges were added to the program
dependence graph twice. This is now no longer the case.
