Version 0.3:

New features:
-------------

- Added more and refined existing example code and example results 
- Added an interactive input option for Semantic Unit identification (lets you choose project name and entry points)
- Finished adding rules for the Semantic Unit identification for C code (we now have a rule for each statement type where it makes sense, more information in the documentation)
- Added more configuration options for the Semantic Unit identification process, like debug output, variability information, different output formats, etc. (see documentation for more details)
- Added a patchGenerator script that transforms the result of the Semantic Unit identification process into a reduced slice of a software project (folders and *.c/*.h code files). 
This can be used as a foundation for patch generation (e.g. with "git merge"). See documentation for more details.
- Improved performance of include analysis
- Added a "IS_HEADER_OF" relation to improve the Semantic Unit identification process



Version 0.2:

New features:
-------------

- Added example code and example results (for SPLC paper)
- Updated documentation
- Allow features (as string input) as entry point for Semantic Unit identification
- Added more rules for the Semantic Unit identification (see commit logs for details) 




Version 0.1:

New features:
-------------

- Added custom script (plotDB) for plotting the whole database as AST or full CPG
- Added custom script (SUI.py) for Semantic Unit identification based on selected entry points
- Refined preprocessor parsing on module and function level
- Add include edges for #include statements that include source files


Bug fixes:
----------

- Fixed problems when resolving preprocessor nesting



Initial Version:

New features:
-------------

- Added custom script for generation of all different graph types (cfg, ast, etc) as .dot and .pn files for every function in a project 
- Moved to a newer Tinkerpop Version (for better performance)


Bug fixes:
----------

- Fixed ResultProcessor
- Removed clone of ocopus tools in mutils
- Fixed memory leak in OctopusClientWriter
- Fixed bugs in documentaion
